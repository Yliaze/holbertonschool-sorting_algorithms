# C - Sorting Algorithms

This project implements various sorting algorithms to sort arrays of integers in ascending order. The goal is to understand different sorting algorithms, evaluate their time complexity using Big O notation, and select the most appropriate algorithm for a given input.

## Background Context

This project is meant to be done in pairs, with each group of two students performing pair programming for the mandatory part. It focuses on understanding sorting algorithms, Big O notation, and selecting the best algorithm for a given input.

## Usage

To use the sorting algorithms implemented in this project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:    

-   `git clone https://github.com/your_username/sorting_algorithms.git` 
    
2.   Compile the files:
    
-   `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o sort` 
    
3.   Run the program:    

- `./sort` 
    
4.  Follow the on-screen instructions to test different sorting algorithms on arrays of integers.
    

## Tests

To test the sorting algorithms with large sets of random integers, you can use the website [Random.org](https://www.random.org/).
